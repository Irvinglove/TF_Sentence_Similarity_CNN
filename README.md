# TF_Sentence_Similarity_CNN
This code belongs to the "[Implementing a CNN for Sentence Similarity in Tensorflow](http://blog.csdn.net/irving_zhang/article/details/70036708)" blog post.

# Requirements：
 - Python 2.7
 - Tensorflow 1.0
 - numpy
 
# Notes:
 Because the glove file is too big, there is no way to upload. Please go to the official website to download [glove.6B.50d.txt](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). 
 
# You should add 
 ```
 400000 50
 ```
# at the first row in the glove.6B.50d.txt file, after that we could read the glove with word2vec tools.
 
 Hava a good time!
